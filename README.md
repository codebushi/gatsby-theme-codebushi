# Code Bushi Theme Starter

## Quick Start

This is a library, intended to be loaded into a working theme:

```bash
yarn add gatsby-theme-codebushi
```

## Beta Testing

You can also use this to test & build your theme. For example, download an
early release of
[Starter Lander](https://github.com/codebushi/gatsby-starter-lander)
inside the `gatsby-theme-codebushi/` folder.

```bash
yarn install
yarn workspace gatsby-starter-lander develop
```

See the top level `gatsby-theme-codebushi/package.json` for detailed examples.

Make sure that your nested workspace repo calls the right version of
**"gatsby-theme-codebushi": "^1.1"** in its package.json. For the above example,
we'd set the version in
`gatsby-theme-codebushi/gatsby-starter-lander/package.json`

Happy hacking!
